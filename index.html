<h1> My weekly Data-Viz inspirations </h1>

<p> Once a week, i'm used to get inspirations for my datavizualization work. 
    Here is my 3 favourite spots to get some ideas ! </p>

<h2> 1. <a href= "https://public.tableau.com/en-gb/s/viz-gallery"> Tableau public gallery </a>  </h2>

<p> Tableau Public gallery is one of my favourite source of inspirations. Tableau's best users seem to master artwork datavisualizations. They are equally good artists and analysts.</p>
<p> To enjoy even more vizzes and learn there best pratices, you can see the Iron VIz challenge finalists in live on this <a href="https://youtu.be/Aj5bd6AstHQ"> YouTube video </a> </p>
